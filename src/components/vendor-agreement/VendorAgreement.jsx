            <p>
              Property owners and tenants are connected directly through
              Trans23's search portal interface, which provides a portal
              interface for locating properties. Business Partners provide a
              range of services (described below) for a fee. As part of its
              normal business activities, Trans23 connects prospective customers
              for leasing, buying, selling, or renting. It is sometimes
              convenient for such customers to use the services of a logistics
              company when relocating their goods (defined below). Trans23
              assists its customers in moving such goods by acting as a Goods
              Transport Agency. A Business Partner (defined below) may provide
              Trans23 with certain services on the terms and conditions outlined
              in this Agreement, which have been mutually agreed upon by them

              The Parties intend all provisions of this Agreement to be enforced
              to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. If, however,
              any provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or
              nonenforceable under any present or future law, such provision
              shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall be construed and
              enforced as if the such unlawful, ineffective, or unenforceable
              provision was never a part hereof. The remaining provisions of
              this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not
              be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or
              by its severance; and, instead of the such illegal, invalid, or
              unenforceable provision, there shall be added as a part of this
              Agreement a provision as similar in its terms to such illegal,
              invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be
              legal, valid, and enforceable.
            </p>
            <h4>(g) Further Acts</h4>
            <p>
              Each Party will without further consideration sign, execute, and
              deliver any document and shall perform any other activities which
              may be necessary or desirable to give full effect to this
              Agreement and each of the business structures contemplated under
              this Agreement.
            </p>
            <h4>(h) Stamp Duty</h4>
            <p>
              Stamp duty (if imposed) on this Agreement shall be borne and paid
              by the Parties equally.
            </p>
            <h4>(i) Costs</h4>
            <p>

              includes without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal
              counsel, accountants, brokers, consultants, and other
              representatives used or hired in connection with the negotiation
              and preparation of this Agreement.
            </p>
            <h4>(j) Amendment</h4>
            <p>
              No variation of this Agreement shall be binding on any Party
              unless such variation is in writing and signed by each Party.
            </p>
            <h4>(k) Counterparts</h4>
            <p>
              This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of
              counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original. But all of
              which will constitute the same agreement.
            </p>
            <h4>(L) Survival</h4>
            <p>
              The requirements and covenants of clauses hereunder which by their
              nature survive termination, shall survive and continue in full
              force and effect after the termination of this Agreement.
            </p>
